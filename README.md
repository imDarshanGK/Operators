# logical operators
There are used to compare two relational expressions, after comparison it gives True or False.

    True
    False
    False
    False
    True
    True
    True
    False
    False
    True
# Assignment Operators
In fix which are used to perform operations on variables or operands and assign values to the operand on the leftside of the operator.

    a= 40
    a+= 80
    a-= 40
    a*= 1600
    a/= 40.0
    a%= 0.0
    a//= 0.0
# Relational operators
It is used to compare the two operands and it returns true or false.

    True
    False
    True
    False
    True
    True
    False
