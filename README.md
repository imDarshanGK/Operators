# logical operators
There are used to compare two relational expressions, after comparison it gives True or False.

    True
    False
    False
    False
    True
    True
    True
    False
    False

# Assignment Operators
In fix which are used to perform operations on variables or operands and assign values to the operand on the leftside of the operator.

    a= 40
    a+= 80
    a-= 40
    a*= 1600
    a/= 40.0
    a%= 0.0
    a//= 0.0
    
# Relational operators
It is used to compare the two operands and it returns true or false.

    True
    False
    True
    False
    True
    True
    False

1} Bitwise Right Shift Operator

    The bitwise right shift operator in python shifts the bits of the binary representation of the input number to the right side by a specified number of places. The empty bits created by shifting the bits 
    are filled by 0s. 

2} Bitwise Left Shift Operator

    The bitwise left shift operator in Python shifts the bits of the binary representation of the input number to the left side by a specified number of places. The empty bits created by shifting the bits 
    are filled by 0s.  

Right shift

    Right shift is: 1

Left shift

    Left shift is: 48
